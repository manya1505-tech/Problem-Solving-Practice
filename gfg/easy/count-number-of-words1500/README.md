# Count Words in String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**  consisting of lowercase English alphabets, spaces, tab characters (\t), and newline characters (\n),  **count**  the total number of  **words**  present in the string. A word is defined as a continuous sequence of lowercase English letters, while spaces, tabs, and newline characters act as separators between words.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "abc def"
Output: 2
Explanation: There is a space at 4th position which works as a seperator between "abc" and "def".

```

```
Input: s = "a\nyo\t"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two words in the string: "a" and "yo". The characters \n and \t act as separators, splitting the string into words.
```

 **Constraints:** 
2 <= Length of String <= 106

        return words.length;
